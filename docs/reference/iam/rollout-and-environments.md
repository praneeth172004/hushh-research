# Rollout and Environments

## Purpose

Define environment policy for IAM changes without risking production behavior.

## Environment Matrix

| Environment | Purpose | IAM Change Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| local | Developer iteration and contract validation | Local-only tests; no production resources |
| uat | Integration validation for actor flows and verification gates | Environment-owned deployment lane (`deploy_uat`) |
| production | Live user traffic | No IAM contract change without explicit promotion gate |

## Promotion Rules

1. IAM changes start in local, then UAT.
2. UAT checklist must pass before production consideration.
3. Production promotion requires explicit approval and rollback plan.
4. Runtime behavior is environment-owned (`ENVIRONMENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`), not RIA feature-flag-driven.

## Branch and CI Rules

1. Route/API contract checks are mandatory.
2. Docs integrity and runtime parity checks are mandatory.
3. Security/compliance checks must pass for verification and consent policy paths.

## Non-Breaking Requirements

1. Existing investor routes remain backward compatible.
2. New actor routes must be isolated and protected by auth + consent + scope policy.
3. Consent audit semantics must remain append-only and traceable.
