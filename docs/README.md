# Hushh Documentation

> Canonical entry point for repo-level documentation.

Hushh is a Personal Agent platform built on four operational invariants:

1. BYOK: server stores ciphertext only.
2. Consent-first: every data access path is consent-gated.
3. Tri-flow: web, iOS, and Android stay contract-aligned.
4. Minimal browser storage: sensitive credentials remain in memory.

For repo setup, see [`readme.md`](../readme.md) and [`getting_started.md`](../getting_started.md).
